# HelvetiCoin Logo Placeholder

The actual logo file (logo.png) should be placed in this directory.

The logo was provided in the project requirements as ![image1](image1) and should be:
- Converted to PNG format
- Named as `logo.png`  
- Optimized for web usage
- Available in multiple variations:
  - `logo.png` - Primary logo
  - `logo-white.png` - White version for dark backgrounds
  - `logo-icon.png` - Icon-only version
  - `logo-text.png` - Text-only version

## Temporary Logo Solution

For development purposes, we're using a CSS-generated logo with the Swiss red "H" character in the navigation and branding elements.

## Implementation

Once the actual logo files are available:

1. Replace this placeholder with the real logo files
2. Update the Next.js Image components in the frontend
3. Update the branding references in the README
4. Ensure proper sizing and responsive behavior

The logo should embody Swiss design principles:
- Clean, minimalist design
- Swiss red (#DC143C) as primary color
- Professional typography
- Swiss cross integration (if appropriate)
- Scalable vector format preferred
